I graduated from Tianjin University with a master's degree in 2022.  From 2020 to 2021, I studied in the Brainnetome Center， CASIA，supervised by Lingzhong Fan.  My research interests include deep learning, interpretability, and brain age prediction.  Currently，I am working in Xiaomi Technology Co., LTD., as a software development engineer.
