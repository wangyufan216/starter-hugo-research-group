I am a fourth-year PhD student at BrainnetomeCenter, CASIA, supervised by Lingzhong Fan. My research interest includes application of imaging-genetics to explore the biological basis of brain structure and function, while also focusing on the increasingly updated higher functions and neuropychiatric disorders associated with the human cerebellum.
