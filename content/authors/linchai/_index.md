Hi, I’m Lin Chai. I received my bachelor’s degree from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT) and master’s degree from Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences. During studying in Brainnetome Center, I followed Professor Lingzhong Fan on machine learning & deep learning application in psychiatry of cerebellum. We aimed to deep dive about cerebellar morphology change & clinical domain knowledges. It was my honor to join Fan lab and did meaningful studies with these interesting guys. Always love our innovative and passionate team!
