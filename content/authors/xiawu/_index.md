I am a direct PhD student from the Brain Network Group of the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and my supervisor is Fan Lingzhong. My main research direction is to explore the damage patterns of the human brain based on diffusion magnetic resonance imaging, and to diagnose and predict different diseases caused by damage.
