abstract: The topography of human functional brain network not only differs between individuals but also reconfigures according to the specific brain state. However, it remains unknown how the fine-grained functional boundaries change in different individuals and states. Instead of using within-parcel features, we proposed an avenue to directly investigate the individual boundary differences and state-specific reconfigurations of functional topography using the boundary mapping method. By quantitatively calculating the inter-subject and intra-subject boundary variation rankings of different states and networks, we observed that the individual variation of functional boundaries is higher in the resting state compared to other task states, and is particularly variable in high-order association networks. In addition, we also proved that the parcel boundaries within individuals are significantly more similar than those between individuals from the view of boundary variation. Our results reveal the spatio-temporal distribution of the inter and intra individual functional topography variations and emphasize the importance of considering the individualized functional parcellation for understanding the dynamic of brain organization.
