abstract: Evidence suggests that disruptions of the posteromedial cortex (PMC) and posteromedial corticothalamic connectivity contribute to disorders of consciousness (DOCs). While most previous studies treated the PMC as a whole, this structure is functionally heterogeneous. The present study investigated whether particular subdivisions of the PMC are specifically associated with DOCs. Participants were DOC patients, 21 vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (VS/UWS), 12 minimally conscious state (MCS), and 29 healthy controls. Individual PMC and thalamus were divided into distinct subdivisions by their fiber tractograpy to each other and default mode regions, and white matter integrity and brain activity between/within subdivisions were assessed. The thalamus was represented mainly in the dorsal and posterior portions of the PMC, and the white matter tracts connecting these subdivisions to the thalamus had less integrity in VS/UWS patients than in MCS patients and healthy controls. In addition, these tracts had less integrity in DOC patients who did not recover after 12â€¯months than in patients who did. The structural substrates were validated by resting state fMRI finding impaired functional activity within these PMC subdivisions. This study is the first to show that tracts from dorsal and posterior subdivisions of the PMC to the thalamus contribute to DOCs.
