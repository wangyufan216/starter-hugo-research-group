Thirdly, it needs to combine invasive neuroscience techniques and using non-human primate models to verify the biological substrates of the imaging-based atlas. Non-human primates have the closest evolutionary relationship with humans, especially in terms of the structure and function of the nervous system, and they are more closely related to humans than other experimental animals. At present, mapping of the non-human primate brains is incomplete and relatively preliminary, which has limited our understanding of brain structure and function. Therefore, comparative studies among primate species will help to further clarify the similarities and differences in the structure and function of the brain between non-human primates and humans. It is not only important to understand the unique cognitive functions of the human brain but also essential for the establishment of non-human primate models of major brain diseases and the development of new techniques for diagnosis and therapy.
