Firstly, most of these human brain atlases, including the current version of the human Brainnetome atlas, are still population-based atlases. Therefore, constructing individualized brain atlases for specific individuals remains a challenging topic due to the large variations in brain size, connectivity, and function across subjects. To meet the requirements in clinical applications, a precise individual brain atlas is needed to reflect the individual characteristics of the brain architecture, as well as demonstrate high repeatability and consistency across different MRI scanners and brain states. Recently, several approaches utilizing machine learning for integrating connectivity information for brain atlas individualization have been proposed.
